basic idea:
 apply random indexing (KKH 2000)
  [ in which the meaning of a word is the sum of "index" vectors representation word contexts ]

 to some other type of graph

 page 15 finally reveals what this other type of graph is:
   nodes are either single words or multiword phrases,
   weights are the conditional prob of the successor given the predecessor (linearly)

 are r_x initialized to zero?
 and i_y initialized to random vectors of size _____ ?



p2 Marr's computational level is not identical to rational models
 however, it is true that rational models are often pitched at Marr's computational level

p2 third paragraph seems to presuppose that domain-generality is the right answer for something important
 shouldn't this be an empirical issue?


p5  "unlike neural networks, computation in VSAs is performed with algebraic operators."
what could this mean? certainly a connectionist net can be viewed as an algebraic operator
in fact this actually what a neural net programmer does when he or she sits down to write the simulator


p5 repeats the myth that Tensor Products are space-inefficient.
if the thesis is going to include this, there needs to be an extensive reply to chapter 5
of _The Harmonic Mind_. it would be easier to just acknowledge the intellectual debt and move on.

p9 text runs off the page


p10 I did not understand 4.4.
     compositionality is a property that our theories of the mind either have or don't have
     such a property might *contribute* to generalization performance, but generalization is a task
    i.e. something that inductive procedures do, not an attribute of cognitive theories.



p12 4.4.2 I think there is supposed to be a space between D and N on the rhs of the NP rule


p14 "mainly for illustrative purposes" what is being illustrated, for what purpose?
where is ProbGraph defined?

p16 what is the difference between "hierarchical" merge and "compositional" merge?
make sure to report the measure of chunkiness used

p22 spellcheck words like "Thee" and "preformance"

p24 why are "cognitive sciences" pluralized? isn't this thesis a contribution to the field, _Cognitive Science_ ?
say it loud, say it proud.
