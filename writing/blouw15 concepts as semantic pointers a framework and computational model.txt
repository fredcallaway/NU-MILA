Abstract The reconciliation of theories of concepts based on prototypes, exemplars, and theory-like structures is a longstanding problem in cognitive science. In response to this problem, researchers have recently tended to adopt either hybrid theories that combine various kinds of representational structure, or eliminative theories that replace concepts with a more finely grained taxonomy of mental representations. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach involving a single class of mental representations called “semantic pointers.” Semantic pointers are symbol-like representa- tions that result from the compression and recursive binding of perceptual, lexical, and motor representations, effectively integrating traditional connectionist and symbolic approaches. We pres- ent a computational model using semantic pointers that replicates experimental data from categori- zation studies involving each prior paradigm. We argue that a framework involving semantic pointers can provide a unified account of conceptual phenomena, and we compare our framework to existing alternatives in accounting for the scope, content, recursive combination, and neural implementation of concepts.

esearchers have developed very different views regarding how concepts are structured and represented in the brain.

conflicting explanatory goals

To deal with this impasse, researchers have most recently tended to adopt one of two general strategies. The first strategy involves the proposal of “mixed” or “pluralistic” models in which individual concepts correspond to a number of related or co-referring representational structures that account for different phenomena (Laurence & Margolis, 1999; Murphy, 2002; Weiskopf, 2009). The second strategy, in contrast, involves elimi- nating the term “concept” from the vocabulary of the cognitive sciences in favor of a tax- onomy of more finely grained mental representations that each serve distinct functions

semantic pointers are neurally instantiated, symbol-like representations that can be transformed in numerous ways to yield further representations that function to support cognitive processes like categoriza- tion, inference, and language use

descriptions of additional conceptual processes involving inference and language can be understood partly as more complex forms of categorization.

We focus exclusively on categorization effects in our simulations because of these and related considerations.1

NEF is occasionally characterized as a compiler that translates algorithms defined over vectors into a language of neural spike

computa- tions involving vectors can be used to implement powerful forms of recursive binding (Gayler, 1998; Kanerva, 1994; Plate, 2003; Smolensky, 1990)

he reason why the representations are referred to as pointers is because they can be used to “point to” or regenerate representations at lower levels in the compression network (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006).

Successful neural simula- tions of conceptual tasks such as simple linguistic inference (Eliasmith, 2013), inductive reasoning (Rasmussen & Eliasmith, 2011), and rule-based problem solving (Stewart & Eliasmith, 2011) have all been produced using semantic pointers

* Underline, page 7
It is better, then, to think of a semantic pointer as an entity that enables the occurrence of a concept rather than as an entity that is equivalent to a concept.

o possess a concept is to be able to activate various sequences of neural states that correspond to things like visual and auditory simulations, expressions of natural language, and motor commands all centered on a single category

concept are context and task dependent (Barsalou, 1999).

Given this description, it is important to consider the obvious similarities between our view and recently developed “neo-empiricist” accounts that identify conceptual process- ing with the partial re-activation of previously captured perceptual states (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; Barsalou, Simmons, Barbey, & Wilson, 2003; Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, & Wilson, 2008; Prinz, 2002). Barsalou (1999), for example, identifies concepts with “simu- lators” or organized systems of category-specific perceptual symbols that can be selec- tively transferred into working memory

* Highlight, page 9
Further similarities are also evident between the semantic pointer framework and con- nectionist models that are trained through gradient descent to associate various modality- specific representations

* Highlight, page 9
Connectionist models that learn to associate representations have no means by which to bind representations recursively, and thus no means by which to account for compound concepts or syntactically structured representa- tions.

We focus our modeling efforts on three paradigmatic categorization studies. The first study, conducted by Posner and Keele (1968), suggests that when subjects learn to cate- gorize patterns of dots generated through the disturbance of various prototype patterns, they abstract and utilize information about the relevant prototype. The second study, con- ducted by Regehr and Brooks (1993), demonstrates that similarity-based categorization strategies can override more analytic strategies under certain circumstances. The third study, conducted by Lin and Murphy (1997), investigates the effects of background knowledge on categorization decisions involving identical visual stimuli given distinct functional descriptions

the model architecture involves a working memory system, an action selection system, and two further subsystems that implement perceptual and inferential evaluations of input stimul

Anatomically, the action selection system is mapped on to portions of basal ganglia and thalamus, while the other subsystems are mapped on to cortex

(a) compare the stimulus to previously learned exemplars or (b) apply a set of rules that define category membership.

LableEi denotes a vector representing the category label for Ei.
@fred: where do the labels come from 

* Highlight, page 12
these schemes are chosen to accommodate specific categorization experiments and are not reflective of the representa- tional power of our framework.

* Highlight, page 12
The system consists of a collection of neural populations anatomically mapped to basal ganglia, and the input populations corre- sponding to the striatum encode the similarity (i.e., dot product) between each monitored representational state and the states that trigger particular actions
@fred: i.e. a production system

* Highlight, page 13
The output of the inferential evaluation system at the conclusion of processing thus takes on the following mathematical description:
@fred: where do these rules come from? I imagine the action selection module? Are they learned?

* Strike Out, page 14
It could be argued that because we have defined different actions for different task contexts, we have really proposed a hybrid model of some kind. However, this is analogous to arguing that a calculator does not provide a unified implementation of arithmetic
@fred: bad analogy. Most of the buttons on a calculator are just shortcuts for combinations of other buttons. This is why we consider mathematical operations unified. It’s not so for this model.

* Strike Out, page 15
The three prototypes are constructed through a slightly constrained form of random vector generation to ensure a certain degree of similarity, before being normalized to unit length.
@fred: seems like a pretty major step

* Strike Out, page 16
To run a trial of the experiment, an instance of the model is created with a seman- tic pointer encoding 12 labeled training images
@fred: SUPERVISED!!

Is this architecture capable of discerning categories from their internal structures?

* Strike Out, page 16
The task vector triggers an action which updates a task context representation in working memory
@fred: why is the task indicator a vector? is the similarity between tasks modeled?

Importantly, the perceptual character of each feature can vary across the drawings. For example, a “long neck” feature might have various curves in one drawing while being comparatively straight in another. The presence or absence of these sorts of perceptual differences across analytically identical drawings is used to define two experimental con- ditions

For the GT items, perceptual similarity is suggestive of the correct decision, while in the case of the BT items, perceptual similarity is suggestive of the incorrect decision.

* Highlight, page 19
Results from the experiment indicate that subjects in the composite condition make roughly the same percentage of categorization errors on training, GT, and BT items in the transfer phase. In the individuated condition, however, a significantly greater propor- tion of errors are reported for BT items.
@fred: evidence that specific details of exemplars are remembered. I wonder what would happen as you increased training time to make more clear what features matter. Would behavior become more rule-like?

To model this experiment, we assume that each simulated participant has learned a semantic pointer that encodes a category description as a set of simple rules.

* Strike Out, page 25
We do not model the process by which the values of r are learned.

* Strike Out, page 26
As such, the model is appropriately sensitive to how consistent a given stimulus is with respect to a simple knowledge base encoded into a set of rules.
@fred: but they don’t model how the rules are learned!

* Highlight, page 29
Eliasmith (2013) demonstrates that simple sentences can be encoded using semantic pointers that bind representations of words to representations of the grammatical roles they occupy, and Stewart, Choo and Eliasmith (2014) suggest a means of parsing simple natural language sentences with this same architecture.
