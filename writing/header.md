    Structured representation has a critical role in cognition, thus modeling structured representation has a critical role in cognitive science. However, the lack of a unified representational framework stands in the way of connecting the insights generated by models of different domains. To address this challenge, we suggest graphs as a domain-general tool for representing high level models. A further challenge arises from the need to model cognition at multiple levels of analysis. Drawing on work in Vector Symbolic Architectures, we suggest an implementation of a graph with high dimensional vectors, employing representations and operations thought to be characteristic of neural processing. We discuss approaches and challenges for modeling generalization and compositionality within this framework. Finally, we implement a simple graphical language acquisition model using the VectorGraph to demonstrate how it can be used in cognitive modeling
