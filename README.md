# NU-MILA

NU-MILA is a model of the acquisition, production, and comprehension of language based on U-MILA (Kolodny, Lotem, & Edelman, 2014). (N)U-MILA uses a graph to represent linguistic knowledge, with words, chunks, and categories as vertices. Weighted edges represent transitional probability, category membership, and chunk composition.

NU-MILA extends U-MILA in three ways:

1. Stricter memory constraints for psychological plausibility
2. More flexible use of categorical knowledge
3. Explicit modeling of the dynamics of comprehension

The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the utility and feasibility of modeling acquisition, production, and comprehension at one time. By modeling these three aspects of language at once, we avoid the possibility of constructing theories that do not meet the constraints imposed by each part of the language system. The evolutionary and cultural aspects of the language system are notably missing from the present model.
