# Nümila

Nümila is a model of language acquisition, comprehension, and production. It represents its knowledge as a graph with words and hierarchical chunks as vertices and transitional probabilities as edges. The graph is implemented with holographic representations. Nümila is an attempt to combine elements of usage based theories of language acquisition with the hierarchically structured representations of traditional linguistics. 

See the [model description](https://github.com/fredcallaway/NU-MILA/blob/master/writing/overview.pdf) for details.

See this [ipython notebook](https://github.com/fredcallaway/NU-MILA/blob/master/numila/analysis.ipynb) for an in-progress analysis of the model's behavior.
